# JavaScript Loose Typing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript related to loose typing and the addition operator (+).  The `bug.js` file contains code that produces unexpected results due to the way JavaScript handles undefined and null values in arithmetic operations.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to mitigate this issue using explicit checks for undefined or null values or employing a stricter type checking approach.  This example showcases the importance of defensive programming in JavaScript to handle potential type errors and avoid unexpected behavior.
